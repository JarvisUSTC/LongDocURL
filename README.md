# About LongDocURL
The LongDocURL benchmark is specifically designed for assessing the ability of models in long document understanding.
We collect 2,325 high-quality question-answering pairs, covering 396 PDF-formatted documents and more than 33,000 pages, significantly outperforming existing benchmarks.
Our open dataset can be found at [LongDocURL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dengchao/LongDocURL/). You can refer to [Dataset Website](https://longdocurl.github.io/) for more infomation.

# Evaluation

**1. (Optional) Download & Extract PDFs**

Download PDFs and qa file (.jsonl) from [LongDocURL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dengchao/LongDocURL/). Run the following commands to extract PDFs into pngs and json files (by PyMuPDF).

```bash
bash utils/run_extract_ccpdf.sh
```

**2. Evaluating API Models**
```bash
bash scripts/eval_api_models.sh
```
